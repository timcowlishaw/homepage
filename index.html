        I make digital things, and help people make sense of numbers and data. I&rsquo;m based in London, in the UK.
        </p><p>
          I&rsquo;ve a varied set of skills, with a background in software engineering, computer science, mathematics and statistics, as well as a bit of graphic, motion and interaction design.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you need assistance with a software project, or need to analyse, visualise or gather quantitative data and research, I can almost certainly help. I&rsquo;ve been working at the intersection of mathematics, technology and design for over eight years, and have been an independent contractor for the last two.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you work for a charity, public-sector or campaigning organization with a focus on sustanability, environment, equality, or social justice, please do get in touch, in particular. I&rsquo;ve a strong preference for work that helps build the sort of future I&rsquo;d like to see for our planet and society, and to that end I&rsquo;m prepared to offer substantially discounted rates to any organizations working towards a similar vision!
